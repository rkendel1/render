# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository. This will prompt you to select
which packages have changed and what type of version bump (major, minor, or patch) should be applied.

All `@json-render/*` packages are versioned together -- a changeset for any one of them will bump all
packages to the same version.
